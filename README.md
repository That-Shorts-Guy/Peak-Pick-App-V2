# Peak-Pick-App-V2
Peak Picker for chemistry spectra

Basic JavaScript app that allows a user to upload some chemistry spectra data in the form of a text file, and plot this data.


Current Functionality
------------------------
-Allows user to upload data -> if text in 1st line of data file, then uses these as axis titles
                            -> test data files added to this repository
                            
-Allows user to plot this uploaded data

-Zoom feature has been added although issues with this. Currently, the axes scale with the graph however the graph will appear outside the axes limits.

-similiar issue with panning, allows user to move graph outside of axes
